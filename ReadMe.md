PiWall
============

Connecting to untrusted wifi access points can be dangerous. PiWall creates a personal WiFi access point that acts as a bridge between your devices and your VPN provider. This allows you to hide your traffic from the wifi provider you are conencted to. It's meant to be used when traveling but can just as well be used at home.

This project is under development and not ready for production use.
